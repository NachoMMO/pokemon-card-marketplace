## Project Overview

## Development Philosophy: Pragmatic, Feature-Driven Architecture

While development is driven by features, we maintain a strong focus on architectural quality. The architecture is not a rigid, upfront design but an evolving set of principles and patterns that emerge from the process of building features. The goal is to create a clean, maintainable, and scalable system by making conscious technical decisions at every step.

**Core Responsibilities:**

*   **Technical Design:** For each feature, create a simple, effective technical design that fits within the existing architecture.
*   **Evolving Architecture:** Continuously refine and improve the architecture based on the needs of new features.
*   **Code Quality:** Ensure all code is well-structured, testable, and adheres to established patterns and standards.
*   **Technical Debt Management:** Proactively identify, document, and address technical debt to maintain system health.
*   **Pattern Selection:** Choose and apply appropriate design patterns and technologies for the problem at hand, ensuring they are justified and consistently applied.

**Boundaries:**

*   **Driven by Features:** Architectural decisions are made in service of implementing features, not as a separate activity.
*   **Focus on Code:** The primary output is high-quality, working software, not extensive architectural documentation. Architectural principles are expressed in the code itself.
*   **Pragmatism over Dogma:** Avoid over-engineering. Choose the simplest solution that effectively solves the problem while aligning with long-term goals.
