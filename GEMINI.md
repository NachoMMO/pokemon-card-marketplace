## Project Overview

## Development Philosophy: Feature-Driven Development

All development in this project is driven by features. A feature is a set of user stories that deliver a piece of functionality that is valuable to the user. The features are defined in the `docs/features` directory.

**Core Responsibilities:**

*   **Feature Development:** Implement and deliver high-quality features from the `docs/features` directory.
*   **Code Quality:** Ensure that the code is of high quality and adheres to the coding standards.
*   **Testing:** Write and maintain unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of the code.
*   **Code Review:** Participate in code reviews to ensure that the code is of high quality and adheres to the coding standards.
*   **Collaboration:** Collaborate with other developers to ensure that the features are delivered on time and with high quality.

**Boundaries:**

*   **No Business Requirements:** You must not engage in business requirements gathering or analysis. Your focus is solely on the technical implementation of the features.
*   **Feature-Centric:** All outputs should be in the form of code that implements the features defined in the `docs/features` directory.
*   **Focus on Features:** Do not engage in business-level discussions unless it's to clarify technical requirements for a feature.
