# Project Plan: Pokemon Card Marketplace (TDD Approach)

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the project plan for creating a web application for buying and selling Pokemon TCG cards, following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. The application will allow users to browse a large catalog of cards, manage their collections, and interact with other users in a dedicated marketplace.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Application:** Vue 3 SPA with Composition API (Hexagonal Architecture)
*   **External Backend:** Supabase (Database + Edge Functions + Auth + Realtime + Storage)
*   **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL
*   **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
*   **Real-time:** Supabase Realtime
*   **File Storage:** Supabase Storage (for card images)
*   **Testing:** Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests
*   **State Management:** Pinia
*   **Routing:** Vue Router
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Linting:** ESLint
*   **Formatting:** Prettier
*   **Version Control:** Git
*   **Hosting:** Vercel

## 3. Development Approach: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

The project will be built feature by feature, following a strict TDD cycle for Vue 3 hexagonal architecture development with Supabase integration. The Gherkin `.feature` files in the `docs/features` directory will serve as the primary source of truth for the requirements of each feature.

The TDD cycle will follow the hexagonal architecture layers:
1.  **Domain Layer TDD:** Write failing tests for business entities and use cases, then implement pure business logic.
2.  **Application Layer TDD:** Write tests for port interfaces and DTOs, ensuring proper contracts.
3.  **Infrastructure Layer TDD:** Write tests for Supabase adapters and Vue composables, implementing external integrations.
4.  **Presentation Layer TDD:** Write E2E tests for Vue components and user interactions.

## 4. Vue 3 Hexagonal Architecture with Supabase

The application will implement a complete hexagonal architecture within the Vue 3 SPA, using Supabase as external infrastructure:

*   **Domain Layer:** Pure TypeScript entities and use cases containing all business logic
*   **Application Layer:** Port interfaces defining contracts for external services
*   **Infrastructure Layer:** Concrete adapters implementing Supabase integrations
*   **Presentation Layer:** Vue 3 components consuming domain logic through ports

**Supabase Integration:**
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) accessed through repository adapters
*   **Authentication:** User management through authentication service adapters
*   **Edge Functions:** Complex business logic implementation through service adapters
*   **Real-time:** Live updates through real-time communication adapters
*   **Storage:** File management through storage service adapters
*   **API:** Data access through repository pattern implementations

## 5. Code Quality and Tooling

To ensure high-quality, consistent code, the project will use:
*   **ESLint:** For identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
*   **Prettier:** For automated code formatting.
*   **Supabase CLI:** For local development and database migrations.
*   These tools will be configured to run automatically on pre-commit hooks to maintain code standards.
